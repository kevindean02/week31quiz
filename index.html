    <h2>My Favorite Part of Advanced Web</h2>
    <p>My favorite part about patino is getting to work in teams. I like that I don't have to work out of a book all day.
    the teachers at patino are all helpful and supportive</p>
    <h2>My Least Favorite Part of Advanced Web</h2>
    <p>My Least favorite part about patino is that there is a lot of work. I dislike how at times people don't want to do anything but be loud
    and I also dislike when people complain about the simplest things in the world</p>
